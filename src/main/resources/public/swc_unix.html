<div id="content" class="office-form-subtitle heading-1"><span class="text-format-content">There is a limit of 20 people for each lesson on this workshop. You will receive an email when you have been accepted. If you are not accepted on this workshop we will add you to a waiting list and send you an email to this effect. The Software Carpentries workshop consists of three lessons. You may choose to attend only some or all of the lessons. To receive a Carpentries Certificate of Attendance you have to attend all three lessons. If you are a PhD student and are doing the workshop for credits, you will get 10 credits per day (i.e. per lesson). You have to register separately for each lesson. <br><br><b>Software Carpentries</b> aims  to help researchers get their work done in less time and with less pain  by teaching them basic research computing skills. These hands-on workshops  will cover the topics, <b>The Unix Shell</b>, <b>Version  Control with Git</b>, and <b>Programming with Python</b>. Participants will be  encouraged to help one another and to apply what they have learned to  their own research problems. This workshop only covers the Unix Shell, but if you are interested in the other topics, please consult and register via our website at <a

It has survived so long  because it’s a powerful tool that allows people to do complex things  with just a few keystrokes. More importantly, it helps them combine  existing programs in new ways and automate repetitive tasks so they  aren’t typing the same things over and over again. The use of the shell  is fundamental to using a wide range of other powerful tools and  computing resources (including “high-performance computing”  supercomputers). This lesson will start you on a path towards using  these resources effectively.<br><br><br></span>
