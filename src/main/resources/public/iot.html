    <p>This is a hands-on workshop for novices, aiming to give learners a better understanding of what The Internet of Things actually is. As a researcher you might be interested to know whether IoT is something that could be of benefit to you in your research and we hope that this workshop might help you answer that question.</p>

    <p>You need no experience of programming, IoT or electronics. During the workshop you will build an IoT device using a microcontroller and two sensors and you will be given the code to program the device, enabling it to publish sensed data to the Internet.</p>
