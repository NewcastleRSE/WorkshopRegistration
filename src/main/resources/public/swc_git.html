<div id="content" class="office-form-subtitle heading-1"><span class="text-format-content">There is a limit of 20 people for each lesson on this workshop. You will receive an email when you have been accepted. If you are not accepted on this workshop we will add you to a waiting list and send you an email to this effect. The Software Carpentries workshop consists of three lessons. You may choose to attend only some or all of the lessons. To receive a Carpentries Certificate of Attendance you have to attend all three lessons. If you are a PhD student and are doing the workshop for credits, you will get 10 credits per day (i.e. per lesson). You have to register separately for each lesson. <br><br><i><b>Unless you are familiar with the Unix Shell it is recommended that  you complete the Unix Shell lesson before attempting Version Control  with Git.</b></i><br><br><b>Software Carpentries</b> aims  to help researchers get their work  done in less time and with less pain  by teaching them basic research  computing skills. These hands-on workshops  will cover the topics, <b>The Unix Shell</b>, <b>Version  Control with Git,</b> and <b>Programming with Python</b>.  Participants will be  encouraged to help one another and to apply what  they have learned to  their own research problems. This workshop only  covers Version Control with Git, but if you are interested in the other topics,  please consult and register via our website at  <a

Every large software  development project relies on  it, and most programmers use it for  their small jobs as well. And it  isn’t just for software: books,  papers, small data sets, and anything  that changes over time or needs  to be shared can and should be stored in  a version control system.<br><br>Teams  are not the only ones to  benefit from version control: lone   researchers can benefit immensely.  Keeping a record of what, when, and why something has been changed is extremely useful  for all researchers if they   ever need to come back to the project later  on (e.g., a year later,   when memory has faded).<br><br><b>MarkDown:</b> Markup is a text encoding system which uses symbols to indicate how text should be displayed, for instance bold or italics. Markdown is a simplified, lightweight version of Markup and is used widely in blogging, online software documentation, and instant messaging. We start the day with an introduction to MarkDown to help learners during the Git lesson to format their text.<br><br><br></span>
